# A hands-on research educational course in the design, analysis and interpretation of transcriptomic studies
## Presented by the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, FL

### Overview of the Short Course

The proposed research education program will be focused on topics related to data science, including computing with R/RStudio and Galaxy, statistical analysis and bioinformatic methods, as presented in Table 1. As a means to teach NCI-funded junior faculty data science skills, we have chosen to focus the course on the analysis transcriptomic data (i.e., RNA-seq data), realizing the skills learned in this short course will be applicable to the analysis of other data types. As gene expression studies are a backbone to many cancer studies, this short course will expose participants to concepts in both data science and high-throughput sequencing.

The short course will be taught using hands-on computing exercises, whereby the participants will learn how to complete bioinformatics processing of RNA-seq fastq files, how to complete differential expression analysis, how to complete downstream analysis (e.g., clustering, pathway analysis) and how to access publically available data resources (e.g., TCGA, GEO, CCLE, dbGaP, SRA, NIH Genomic Data Commons) for the validation of results. In doing so, they will become familiar with programming in R/RStudio and Galaxy, along with use of Bioconductor packages. We will also cover concepts related to computational reproducible research and the use of R Markdown. Lastly, we will have a session on the Responsible Conduct of Research. To augment the topics covered in the morning and afternoon session of the short course, we will also have two working dinner in which a keynote speaker will be invited to present on the latest methods used in data science (e.g., deep learning/AI, analysis of single-cell sequencing data) or advances in technology (10x single cell sequencing, onco-immunology and immunotherapy, CRISPR).

In covering the course material, a RNA-seq study will be used in which participants will apply the skills covered in the lecture materials in the hands-on computing component. A second dataset will be provided to the participants on the last day in which they will apply the statistical concepts and computing with R/RStudio to complete the downstream analysis to determine genes and pathways differentially expressed within a reproducible research framework using R Markdown.
